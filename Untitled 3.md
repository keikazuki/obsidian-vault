### Pull Request Notes for Code Review

#### **Summary of Changes**

This PR refactors the `get_status_table` function to improve performance, readability, and maintainability. The previous implementation had multiple inefficiencies, redundant DataFrame operations, and unnecessary loops. The new implementation addresses these issues while maintaining the same functionality.

---

### **Key Improvements**

#### **1. Performance Optimization**

- **Reduced Database Queries**:
    
    - Used `.select_related("track", "annotated_by")` in the query to minimize the number of queries executed for related models.
    - Fetched all `AnnotationTrackSample` records in one query instead of filtering multiple times.
- **Replaced Redundant DataFrame Creations**:
    
    - Previously, separate DataFrames were created for each sample status (`pending_df`, `annotated_df`, etc.), causing unnecessary computations.
    - Now, a **single DataFrame (`all_df`)** is used, and a pivot table (`status_agg`) is leveraged to compute status-specific aggregations in one step.
- **Optimized Word Count Calculation**:
    
    - Used vectorized `str.split().str.len()` instead of applying a function row by row.

#### **2. Code Readability and Maintainability**

- **Refactored Data Processing Logic**:
    
    - Moved repeated logic into a single loop instead of handling each status separately.
    - Introduced `status_mapping` for a cleaner approach to mapping statuses.
- **Improved Data Merging Approach**:
    
    - Used **merge()** operations efficiently to join datasets instead of performing multiple filter and groupby operations.
- **Better Function Naming**:
    
    - Used more descriptive function names like `show_publish_button()` instead of `showPublishButton()`.
- **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:
    
    - Ensured the function correctly handles cases when there are **no tracks** or **no samples**.
    - Avoids errors due to missing columns in DataFrame operations.

---

#### **3. Formatting and UI Consistency**

- **Datetime Formatting**:
    
    - Used `strftime()` to properly format dates for display.
- **Column Selections**:
    
    - Ensured only necessary columns are passed to the UI by dropping `track_id` where appropriate.
- **Cumulative Sum Calculation for Progress Chart**:
    
    - Handles cases where there are no annotations to avoid processing empty DataFrames.

---

### **Performance Gains**

- **Fewer Queries**: Reduced database queries significantly by fetching all necessary data at once.
- **Faster Execution**: Optimized DataFrame operations to minimize computational overhead.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: No longer creating unnecessary intermediate DataFrames.

---

### **Impact of These Changes**

- The function is now **faster, cleaner, and more efficient**.
- Maintains the same functionality while significantly reducing complexity.
- Ensures **scalability** as the dataset grows.

---

### **Next Steps**

- Additional testing with large datasets to confirm speed improvements.
- Consider caching results for frequently accessed data to further enhance performance.
