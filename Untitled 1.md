The primary difference between **HTTP GET** and **HTTP POST** lies in how they send data to the server and their intended use cases.

### **1. HTTP GET**

- **Purpose:** Used to retrieve data from the server.
- **Data Transmission:** Sends data in the **URL as query parameters** (e.g., `https://example.com/api?name=John&age=30`).
- **Visibility:** Data is **visible** in the URL.
- **Caching:** Can be **cached** by browsers and servers.
- **Idempotency:** **Idempotent** (repeating the request should return the same result).
- **Use Case:** Fetching data (e.g., searching, reading a webpage).

### **2. HTTP POST**

- **Purpose:** Used to send data to the server to create or update resources.
- **Data Transmission:** Sends data in the **body of the request** (hidden from the URL).
- **Visibility:** Data is **not visible** in the URL.
- **Caching:** **Not cached** by default.
- **Idempotency:** **Not idempotent** (repeating the request may create multiple records).
- **Use Case:** Submitting forms, uploading files, making API calls that change data.

### **Example Usage**

#### **GET Example**

```http
GET /search?q=chatgpt HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

- Used for retrieving search results.

#### **POST Example**

```http
POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

- Used for submitting a registration form.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **GET** is for retrieving data, **POST** is for sending/modifying data.
- **GET** appends parameters in the URL, **POST** sends data in the request body.
- **GET** can be cached, **POST** usually cannot.
- **GET** is safe and idempotent, **POST** is not.
