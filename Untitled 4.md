Below is an example of how you can explain your changes. You can adjust the language to match your style or the audience’s technical background:

**Overview of Changes**

I refactored the original `get_status_table` function to improve its performance, maintainability, and clarity. The key improvements are:

1. **Reduced Database Queries and DataFrame Overhead**
    
    - **Before:** The code queried the database multiple times by filtering the `AnnotationTrackSample` queryset separately for each status (e.g., pending, annotated, validated, etc.) and then created separate DataFrames for each.
    - **After:** I now fetch all sample records in one go using a single query with `select_related("track", "annotated_by")`. This minimizes the number of database hits and leverages Django’s ORM more efficiently.
2. **Optimized Data Aggregation with Pandas**
    
    - **Before:** The original implementation built several DataFrames and performed multiple groupby operations—one per status. This resulted in redundant calculations and increased memory usage.
    - **After:** I consolidated the data into a single DataFrame and used a pivot table (via `groupby` with an `unstack`) to compute status-specific word counts. This approach leverages Pandas’ vectorized operations, significantly reducing the number of expensive row-wise operations (such as multiple `.apply()` calls).
3. **Improved Computation of Derived Metrics**
    
    - **Before:** Word counts and date formatting were computed repeatedly across different subsets of data.
    - **After:** I compute the `word_count` for all rows at once using vectorized string methods (`.str.split().str.len()`). This not only simplifies the code but also improves performance by reducing repeated calculations.
4. **Cleaner, More Readable Code**
    
    - I added inline comments and organized the code into clear logical sections (fetching data, building the DataFrame, aggregating data, computing completion percentages, and preparing the output).
    - Early returns have been implemented (e.g., if no tracks or no samples exist) to avoid unnecessary processing, which makes the code easier to follow and maintain.
5. **General Refactoring for Maintainability**
    
    - Instead of duplicating similar logic for each status, I created a mapping (`status_mapping`) and looped over it to calculate the completion percentage for each status. This reduces code repetition and makes it easier to add or change statuses in the future.
    - The logic for generating the “publish action” data has been encapsulated in its own function, further isolating responsibilities and improving code clarity.

**Why These Changes Improve Performance**

- **Database Efficiency:** By reducing the number of queries and using `select_related`, we decrease the database load and the latency associated with multiple round trips.
- **Memory and CPU Usage:** Combining data into a single DataFrame and using vectorized operations minimizes memory overhead and speeds up the data processing compared to using multiple DataFrames and repeated groupby operations.
- **Reduced Redundancy:** Aggregating data only once and using pivot tables instead of repetitive filtering and merging cuts down on redundant work, leading to faster execution.
- **Readability and Maintainability:** A cleaner, well-commented codebase makes it easier to debug and optimize further in the future.

**In Summary**

I transformed the original code by consolidating database queries, leveraging Pandas’ efficient, vectorized operations, and streamlining the aggregation logic. These improvements not only boost performance but also make the codebase easier to read and maintain, which is beneficial for long-term scalability and troubleshooting.
